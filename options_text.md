# Estimation options

On this page you can provide options that are passed to the `ezCutoffs` function. These options are categorized into three different sections:

* Data: where you can upload empirical data or set the parameters of simulating data,
* Fit indices: where you can select relevant fit indices and determine the Type-I error rate,
* Estimation: where you can specify settings about the estimation and simulation process, and
* Bootstrapping: where you can request and tweak a bootstrap of the fit indices regarding your empirical data set.
